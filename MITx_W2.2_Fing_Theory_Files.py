"""
How to work with files. Will add some information from Udemy also.

Python provides an operating-system independent means to access files, using file handler



"""

# creates a file and returns file handle which we can name and thus reference
# 'w' means that file is open for writing, 'r' - for reading


# example of writing to a file
# nameHandle = open('kids', 'w')
for i in range(2):
    name = input('Enter name: ')
    # nameHandle.write(name + '\')
# nameHandle.close()

# example of reading the file
# for line in nameHandle:
    # print(line)
# nameHandle.close()
